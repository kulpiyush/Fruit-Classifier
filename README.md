Mango Ripening Classifier

1. Overview

   The Mango Ripening Classifier is a machine learning-based project designed to classify mangoes into three ripeness stages: Raw, Ripe, and Rotten.
   By leveraging deep learning and image processing techniques, this model provides an accurate assessment of mango ripeness from images.

3. Features

 1. Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning model training and inference.
 2. Implements OpenCV2 for image pre-processing and feature extraction.
 3. Trained on a diverse dataset of mango images labeled according to ripeness stages.
 4. Outputs ripeness classification with probability scores for better interpretability.
 5. Employs neural networks to learn patterns and improve accuracy over time.

3. Technologies Used

 1. Machine Learning & Neural Networks: TensorFlow, Keras
 2. Image Processing: OpenCV2
 3. Data Visualization: Matplotlib
 4. Programming Language: Python

4. Dataset & Preprocessing

 1. The dataset consists of labeled mango images categorized into three ripeness stages:
     1. Raw - Unripe mangoes
     2. Ripe - Ready-to-eat mangoes
     3. Rotten - Overripe or decayed mangoes

 2. Before feeding the images into the model:
    
    1. OpenCV2 was used to apply image enhancement and feature extraction.
    2. Images were resized and normalized for consistency.
    3. Data augmentation techniques were applied to improve model generalization.

5. Model Training
     
     1. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on the labeled dataset.
     2. The model was optimized using categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
     3. Training was conducted using a sufficient number of epochs to achieve optimal accuracy.
     4. The trained model was evaluated using test images and confusion matrix analysis.

6. Future Enhancements

   1. Expand the dataset for better model generalization.
   2. Optimize the model for real-time classification on mobile devices.
   3. Integrate the model into a web or mobile application for user-friendly deployment.
